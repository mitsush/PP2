"""
Write a program able to play the "Guess the number" - game, where the number to be guessed is randomly chosen between 1 and 20. 
This is how it should work when run in a terminal:

Hello! What is your name? 
KBTU

Well, KBTU, I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.
Take a guess.
12

Your guess is too low.
Take a guess.
16

Your guess is too low.
Take a guess.
19

Good job, KBTU! You guessed my number in 3 guesses!
